# Raffadax Complete Production Beta 5.0.0-beta.01

Updated for Stardew 1.6.8 by [Logo](https://github.com/Rogue-Toast) and [OnionNinja](https://github.com/scriptsforweirdos).

## Before you Begin

* **No redistribution permitted. This means no linking directly to this repository outside of the [Raffadax Discord](https://discord.gg/kVRFBf794c).**
  * **No redistribution of translations, reskins, and similar auxiliary mods based on this version.** If you want to make a mod or translation which expands on this code, please contact in the Discord first.
* **No streaming, videos or other social media sharing of this version.**
* **This version is not compatible with save files from Stardew 1.5.**
* **This version may not be compatible with the next version either although it will probably be OK.**

## About this Beta

* This is released with Raffadax's permission *temporarily* to the public as a stopgap until he finishes making changes for the actual release on Nexus.
  * It's mostly for other devs to get a head start on compatibility tests, translations, reskins, etc before things go live to Nexus.
  * It's been tested by a great group of alpha testers (thanks y'all!) and is fully playable.
* This is the version that Logo and I gave back to Raffadax after updating the code. It's a direct one-to-one patch to make the old version compatible with Stardew 1.6+
* Bugs should be reported as issues here or in the Discord for the time being rather than on Nexus.
* The eventual Nexus release will feature new artwork, more content, etc. It is expected to release towards the end of 2024 or early in 2025.

## Features and Changes

* Everything in the current version of Raffadax Complete Production on Nexus (v.4.3) still in the mod.
* i18n compatible, although only English is provided for now.
  * Translators please contact us in the Discord before starting.
* Removes several dependencies, including Json Assets, Custom Ore Nodes, Custom Cask Mod, Custom Crystalarium Mod, Miller Time, Mail Framework Mod, Produce to Sapling and Shop Tile Framework.
* Graphics have been combined into spritesheets for faster loading.
* Update keys have been configured so that you should be alerted via SMAPI whenever the next version is posted to Nexus.
* Shop prices have been very slightly adjusted to accommodate for the removal of STF.
* Ore node spawns may be slightly different due to the shift from Custom Ore Nodes to Item Extensions but have been tuned to feel relatively similar.
* New config: Seed Maker Saplings. Controls how Orchard Fruits interact with Seed Makers
  * "Better Saplings": Higher quality fruits yield higher quality saplings, which mature faster.
  * "More Saplings": Higher quality fruits yield more saplings. This is the same behavior as the old Produce to Sapling mod.
